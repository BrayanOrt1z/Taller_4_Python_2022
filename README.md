This activity consists of importing files for statistical analysis using Python libraries. 
To do this, use the files imported in Objective Test 2 and calculate the descriptive statistics, 
histograms and box plots according to what was presented in class. 

The objectives of the activity are the following: 
* Use the Pandas and Scipy libraries for the calculation of statistics with Python.
* Use programming tools (Jupyter Notebook, GitHub Desktop) for development 
of algorithms using the Python language.
